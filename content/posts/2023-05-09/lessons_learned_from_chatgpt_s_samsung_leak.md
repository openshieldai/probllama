Samsung employees reportedly leaked sensitive data via OpenAI’s chatbot ChatGPT, highlighting the risks of using Large Language Models (LLMs) in the workplace. Despite Samsung's ban on generative AI tools, several employees inadvertently shared sensitive company information, including software source code.

The incident, termed "conversational AI leak," occurs when sensitive data input into an LLM is unintentionally exposed. To prevent such leaks, experts recommend controlling the data fed into the models and limiting who can access chatbots. Outright bans may not be effective, as more generative AI tools will be introduced in the future. Instead, organizations should focus on internal controls and monitoring.
